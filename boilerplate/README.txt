I built my submission off of Jeremy Harts code that was shared with us in Tutorial.
The link to the code I used is here: http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~hartja/c587w17/tutorial.html

I completed this assignment on the computers in MS 239.

As per Jeremys initial work, this submission contains a makefile. Simply type "make" to build

Pressing the Space bar will Pause/Play the animation. By default, it is playing.

Press T to toggle the wire track on or off. It appears in blue. This was totally optional. I just
	added this for debugging purposes and perhaps to aid in marking. By defaul this is off.

Press F to toggle first-person mode. By default it is in an model viewing camera (arcball)
	(This is the camera that was included with Jeremy's afforementioned code). It can be
	controlled by clicking and dragging.
